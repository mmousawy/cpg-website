refactor: Photo and album detail page layouts

Redesigned photo and album detail pages with a modern two-column layout inspired by
Instagram and DeviantArt. Desktop shows sticky photo/gallery on left with metadata
sidebar on right. Mobile shows single-column layout with full-width sidebar below content.

Photo Pages:
- Two-column layout: sticky photo column + metadata sidebar
- Photo dynamically sized to fit viewport while preserving aspect ratio
- Blurhash placeholder with smooth fade-in transition
- Sidebar contains author, title/description, date, EXIF, views, tags, likes, comments
- Full-width sidebar on mobile with background and border styling

Album Pages:
- Same two-column sidebar layout as photo pages
- Gallery vertically centered within its column
- Sticky "View in Gallery" button at bottom of gallery
- Container query-based responsive grid (responds to container width not viewport)

New Components:
- AuthorRow - Compact author display with avatar, full name, and @nickname
- PhotoActionBar - Horizontal action bar for likes/views

UI Improvements:
- Added calendar and camera aperture icons for date and EXIF display
- ViewCount icon sizing made consistent at 16px
- Comments section spacing tightened
- BlurImage blurhash sizing improved to prevent cropping
