feat: Changelog detail pages, timestamped view tracking, and justified layout improvements

Changelog:
- Add detail pages for changelog entries at /changelog/[slug]
- Render files-changed.md using react-markdown with custom styled components
- Build version-to-slug and slug-to-version mappings from CHANGELOG.md dates
- Show all versions in overview table with descriptions, link only if folder exists
- Add changelog library with helper functions for reading changelog data

Database:
- Add photo_views and album_views tables for timestamped view tracking
- Update increment_view_count RPC to log individual view events
- Add indexes for efficient weekly queries (photo_id/album_id, viewed_at)
- Add RLS policies allowing public inserts and reads for view tracking

Gallery:
- Update getMostViewedPhotosLastWeek to query from photo_views table
- Count views from last 7 days instead of just using total view_count
- Sort photos by actual weekly view count for accurate trending

Justified Layout:
- Add variety penalty to prevent repetitive row patterns (e.g., PLL, PLL, PLL)
- Calculate row signatures based on aspect ratios (P=portrait, S=square, L=landscape)
- Heavy penalty for identical consecutive patterns, light penalty for same-length rows

PhotosPaginated:
- Store photos in batches instead of flat array
- Each batch maintains its own stable layout during pagination
- Prevents layout shifts when loading more photos
