fix: Fix Supabase image transformations and optimize image sizing

Image Loader Fixes:
- Fix Supabase image transformations by using correct /render/image/public/ endpoint
  (previously used /object/public/ which doesn't support transformations)
- Handle StaticImageData objects from static imports (hero images, camera icon)
- Add width query param to all URLs to satisfy Next.js loader requirements
- External images (gravatar, discord, google, meetupstatic) now load correctly
  (returned as-is since custom loaders can't use /_next/image proxy)

Image Sizing Optimizations:
- HeroImage: Update sizes from 100vw to responsive breakpoints with 1200px max
- JustifiedPhotoGrid: Use dynamic sizes based on actual calculated displayWidth
  with 1.5x multiplier for retina display quality
- Reduces bandwidth by requesting appropriately sized images instead of oversized ones

Files changed:
- src/utils/supabaseImageLoader.ts - Complete rewrite of image loader logic
- src/components/shared/HeroImage.tsx - Responsive sizes with max 1200px
- src/components/photo/JustifiedPhotoGrid.tsx - Dynamic per-image sizing
