feat: add interests system, member discovery, event comments, and reminder cron

Add a shared interests system for member profiles, comprehensive member
discovery pages, event commenting functionality, gallery tag browsing,
and automated event reminder emails via cron job.

Interests system:
- Database migration for interests and profile_interests tables with
  automatic usage count tracking via triggers
- Account settings integration with InterestInput component for adding
  and removing interests
- Public profile display showing member interests below bio
- InterestCloud component for displaying interests with size-based
  styling similar to TagCloud
- Interest discovery page at /members/interest/[interest] showing all
  members with a specific interest

Members discovery:
- Main members page at /members (authenticated users only) with multiple
  discovery sections:
  - Popular interests cloud
  - Featured interests with member samples
  - Recently active members (uploaded photos/albums in last 30 days)
  - New members (recently joined)
  - Explore by photo style (tags with member counts)
- Members by tag page at /members/tag/[tag] showing members who
  frequently use a specific photo tag
- MemberCard component for consistent member display across discovery
  pages

Data layer:
- New interests.ts module with getPopularInterests and
  getMembersByInterest functions
- New members.ts module with getRecentlyActiveMembers, getNewMembers,
  getRandomInterestsWithMembers, and getMembersByTag functions
- getPopularTagsWithMemberCounts in gallery.ts for tag-based discovery
- All functions use 'use cache' with appropriate cache tags

Caching and revalidation:
- Added revalidateInterests and revalidateInterest functions
- Integrated interests revalidation into profile updates and account
  settings save flow
- Fixed randomization in getRandomInterestsWithMembers to use
  deterministic selection for cache consistency
- Added page-level caching to interest and tag member pages
- Photo uploads now invalidate profiles and gallery tags for recently
  active members
- Tag updates invalidate tag-specific member pages
- Updated revalidate-all API to include interests tag

UI improvements:
- Fixed avatar rounding for members without profile pictures using
  Avatar component instead of ClickableAvatar
- Added hover effects to member cards
- Aligned interest tag styling with TagCloud component
- Improved spacing and typography consistency across discovery pages

Event comments:
- Added event_comments junction table linking events to comments
- EventComments component for displaying comments on event pages
- Updated comments API to support event entity type with separate RPC
  function (events use INTEGER IDs vs UUID)
- Admin notifications for event comments (instead of single owner)
- Comments component updated to handle event comments

Gallery tag browsing:
- New gallery tag pages at /gallery/tag/[tag] for browsing photos by tag
- TagCloud component for displaying tags with size-based styling
- PopularTagsSection server component for tag browsing sections
- Gallery page updated to include popular tags section
- JustifiedPhotoGrid enhanced with profile attribution display
- Static generation for all tag pages via generateStaticParams

Event reminders (cron):
- Added database columns rsvp_reminder_sent_at and
  attendee_reminder_sent_at to events table for tracking sent reminders
- Implemented cron job endpoint at /api/cron/event-reminders
- Automated RSVP reminders sent 5 days before events to users who
  haven't RSVP'd (respects email preferences)
- Automated attendee reminders sent 1 day before events to confirmed
  attendees
- Cron job configured in vercel.json to run daily at 8:00 AM UTC
- Protected by CRON_SECRET environment variable authentication
- Uses batch email sending via Resend API with rate limiting

Database migrations:
- Consolidated temp migrations into baseline migration
- Added event_comments table migration
- Added event reminder tracking columns migration
- Added interests system migration
- Cleaned up old temp migration files

Documentation:
- Updated docs/README.md with interests cache tags and examples
- Updated docs/revalidation-quick-reference.md and
  docs/revalidation-system.md with new cache tags
- Added docs/email-notifications.md with cron job documentation
- Updated main README.md with completed discovery features and new
  database tables
- Added exports for interests and members modules in data layer index

Configuration:
- Added CRON_SECRET to .env.example for cron job authentication
- Updated vercel.json with cron job configuration
- Updated .cursorrules with project conventions
