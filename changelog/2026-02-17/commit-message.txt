feat: Newsletter admin tool and opted-out user visibility in email tools

Newsletter Admin Tool:
- Add NewsletterComposer to Admin Tools page (/admin/tools)
- Compose and send newsletters with subject and body (plain text, line breaks preserved)
- Recipient list filtered by newsletter email preference (email_preferences + legacy newsletter_opt_in)
- Send test email to admin's own inbox before full send
- Batch sending via Resend (100 per batch, 500ms delay) - same pattern as event/challenge announcements
- React Email template (newsletter.tsx) with Header, Footer, newsletter unsubscribe link
- POST /api/admin/newsletter/send - accepts subject, body, recipientEmails, testEmail flag

RecipientList and Email Tools:
- RecipientList supports disabled state for opted-out users
- Opted-out users visible in list but checkbox disabled, row grayed out, "Opted out" in Status column
- Header shows "Recipients (X of Y selected, Z opted out)" when applicable
- Select-all only affects selectable (non-opted-out) recipients
- AnnounceEventModal: show all users, disable those who opted out of events
- AnnounceChallengeModal: show all users, disable those who opted out of photo_challenges
- NewsletterComposer: show all users, disable those who opted out of newsletter

Other:
- Fix ProfileSection typo: "andgallery" → "and gallery"
