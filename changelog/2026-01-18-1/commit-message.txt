feat: Add view tracking for photos and albums

Implement client-side view tracking with database storage and display
view counts on detail pages, profile stats, and gallery sections.

View tracking system:
- Add view_count columns to photos and albums tables with indexes
- Create increment_view_count RPC function for atomic updates
- Add /api/views endpoint with bot detection
- Create useViewTracker hook and ViewTracker component for client-side tracking
- Fire-and-forget tracking that doesn't block page rendering

View count display:
- Add ViewCount component with eye icon
- Display view counts on photo and album detail pages
- Add views received stat to account stats page
- Add views received badge to profile stats badges

Gallery enhancements:
- Add "Most viewed this week" photos section to gallery page
- Add "Trending albums" section showing most viewed albums from last week
- Add popular sorting option for albums (sort by view_count)
- Limit all gallery sections to 10 items max

Caching strategy:
- Time-sensitive "most viewed" queries use 1-hour cache
- Standard queries use max cache (view counts update on next invalidation)
- No cache invalidation on view tracking for performance

Bug fixes:
- Add short_id to getMostViewedPhotosLastWeek query for correct photo links
