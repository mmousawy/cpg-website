refactor: Eliminate all `any` types and fix eslint-disable comments

Code quality improvements:
- Remove all 147 instances of `any` types throughout codebase
- Fix 18 eslint-disable comments by addressing root causes
- Replace `catch (err: any)` with proper `unknown` type and instanceof checks
- Remove unnecessary `as any` casts from Supabase queries
- Add proper types for Supabase join results using new query types
- Fix React Hook Form props with proper generics (UseFormRegister, FieldErrors, etc.)
- Add explicit types for callback parameters
- Type Resend API error responses properly
- Add Window interface declaration for global properties

Type infrastructure:
- Create `src/types/supabase-queries.ts` with typed query result types
- Add proper type guards for error handling
- Update base types to include likes_count/view_count fields

ESLint fixes:
- Fix 11 react-hooks/exhaustive-deps violations by moving functions inside useEffect
- Replace 2 <img> tags with Next.js <Image> component
- Clean up remaining eslint-disable comments with proper patterns

Result: 0 TypeScript errors, 0 `any` types, improved type safety throughout
