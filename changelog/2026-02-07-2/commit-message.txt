feat: comment replies and responsive sidebar improvements

Implemented comprehensive comment reply system with nested threading, notifications, and improved UI. Made sidebar responsive with different widths for tablet and desktop.

Database:
- Add parent_comment_id column to comments table with self-referencing foreign key
- Add index for fast reply lookups
- Update add_comment, add_event_comment, and add_challenge_comment functions to support optional parent_comment_id parameter
- Flatten replies to original parent comment (single-level threading)

Comment Replies:
- Add reply UI with nested comment display
- Support replying to top-level comments and other replies
- Track which comment a reply was responding to for visual context
- Add "replied to @nickname" links that scroll to and highlight parent comment
- Implement reply text persistence in localStorage
- Add collapse/expand functionality for nested replies
- Show reply count badges with expand/collapse controls
- Optimize rendering with React.memo and careful prop management

API Routes:
- Update POST /api/comments to accept parentCommentId parameter
- Fetch parent comment author for reply notifications
- Send notifications to both entity owner and parent comment author when replying

Notifications:
- Add comment_reply notification type
- Notify parent comment author when their comment receives a reply
- Update email templates to handle reply notifications with appropriate messaging
- Support email opt-out preferences for reply notifications

UI Improvements:
- Make sidebar responsive: 384px on tablet (md), 512px on desktop (lg)
- Update filmstrip max-width calculations for wider desktop sidebar
- Convert reply button to use Button component with floating bottom-right positioning
- Style reply button as tiny ghost button matching design system

Components:
- Refactor Comments component with CommentItem subcomponent for better organization
- Add memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Improve comment card layout with relative positioning for floating reply button
