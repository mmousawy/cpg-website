<p>We&#39;ve been shipping a lot of updates lately and wanted to give you a quick rundown of what&#39;s new. Whether you&#39;ve been on the site daily or haven&#39;t logged in for a bit, there&#39;s plenty to check out.</p>
<h2>Photo challenges</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve added themed photo challenges where you can submit your best work around a creative prompt. Accepted photos get featured in a challenge gallery and earn a badge on your profile. Check the Challenges page to see what&#39;s running.</p>

<h2>Shared albums</h2>
<p>You can now create collaborative albums and invite other members to contribute. Everyone gets credited for their photos, and you control whether the album is open or invite-only.</p>
<h2>Event albums</h2>
<p>Every event now gets its own photo album automatically. After attending a meetup, you can upload your shots directly to the event page so everyone can relive it together.</p>
<h2>Photo management</h2>
<p>You can now delete your photos directly from the detail page, and paginated lists remember your scroll position when you navigate back.</p>
<h2>Help and FAQ</h2>
<p>We added a full Help page covering everything from getting started to managing your account. Link&#39;s in the footer.</p>
<h2>Mob</h2>
<p>Better mobile layouts across the board — tighter spacing, cleaner cards, smoother animations</p>
<h2>What&#39;s next</h2>
<p>We&#39;re always building. If there&#39;s something you&#39;d love to see, let us know!</p>
<p>In the meantime, log in and poke around. Submit to a challenge, start a shared album, or add your photos to an event. And if you know someone who&#39;d enjoy being part of this, send them our way.</p>
<p>Happy shooting!</p>
